#VChat
##How to Run
You can find the live deployment of this project at the following link:

https://vchat2-daitoshokan.c9users.io

The server is sending a high volume of messages to the chatroom every 5 seconds.
To test client side messaging, you can scroll to the bottom of the chatbox.
The left form contains the username you wish to send messages from, default "Anonymous".
The right form is your message, which can bet sent with "Enter" or the send button.
You may find that Ctrl+F and seaching for your chosen username may help validate that
your messages are among those being sent to the chatroom.
